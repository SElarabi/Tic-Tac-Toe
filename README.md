# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built with ReactJS. It allows two players to play on the same computer, with X and O as the symbols used to mark the squares. The game displays the current player and notifies the winner once the game is over.

How to Play
To play the game, simply click on an empty square to fill it with your symbol. The first player to get three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all squares are filled and there is no winner, the game is a tie.

You can restart the game at any time by clicking the "RESTART" button.
